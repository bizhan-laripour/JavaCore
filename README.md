### Java core project
in this project i tried to make my own framework based on java core and servlets.

i try to make a sample ORM and my own mysql dialect.

i'm trying to focuse on base concepts of Object oriented cincepts like abstraction , inheritance , etc and best practice of design patterns

this is just a warm up in java core and until now it is not completed yet.

try to enjoy coding. this is the way that you can be more eficient and more productive ðŸ˜Š
