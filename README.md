### Java core project
In this project i tried to make my own Framework based on java core and Servlets.

I tried to make a sample ORM and my own Mysql dialect.

I'm trying to focuse on base concepts of Object oriented like abstraction , inheritance , etc and best practice of design patterns

this is just a warm up in java core and it is not completed yet.

try to enjoy coding. this is the way that you can be more eficient and more productive
